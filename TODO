- Use LWP::UserAgent::POE

  This was working until I upgraded from LWP::UserAgent v5.813 to v5.820.
  That seems to have broken LWP::UserAgent::POE's ability to handle
  authentication.

  Ideally, a patch to Net::Twitter allowing a pre-initialized user agent, or
  user_agent_class and user_agent_args in Net::Twitter->new.

- Have IRC use stdin/stdout instead of a listening port so it can be launched
  automatically via inetd.

- Deal with large numbers of friends, followers, statuses.
