- Chose a name: currently using Net::Twitter::IRC, but it may not remain
  Net::Twitter based.

- Use LWP::UserAgent::POE or POE::Component::Client::HTTP direrctly.

  I had working with LWP::UserAgent::POE until I upgraded from LWP::UserAgent
  v5.813 to v5.820.  That seems to have broken LWP::UserAgent::POE's ability to
  handle authentication.

  Ideally, a patch to Net::Twitter allowing a pre-initialized user agent, or
  user_agent_class and user_agent_args in Net::Twitter->new.  (I submitted a
  patch to the author, but no response, yet.)

- Have IRC use stdin/stdout instead of a listening port so it can be launched
  automatically via inetd.  Is that feasible?  If not, make it a daemon and
  don't exit on disconnect.

- Deal with large numbers of friends, followers, statuses.  I currently have
  just a few friends/followers.  Probably need modifications to handle large
  numbers.  Using the blocking Net::Twitter may become a problem for large
  numbers, as well.
