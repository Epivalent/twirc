- Chose a name: currently using Net::Twitter::IRC, but it may not remain
  Net::Twitter based.

- Have IRC use stdin/stdout instead of a listening port so it can be launched
  automatically via inetd.  Is that feasible?  If not, make it a daemon and
  don't exit on disconnect.

- Deal with large numbers of friends, followers, statuses.  I currently have
  just a few friends/followers.  Probably need modifications to handle large
  numbers.

- Does friends_timeline get @replies from non-friends, too, or do I also need
  to call /statuses/replies?  The API doc say friends_timeline is equivalent
  to twitter.com/home, so I assume not.
